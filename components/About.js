          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I've spent my career as the first marketing hire at early-stage startups, which means building everything from scratch: strategy, systems, content, events, and cross-functional processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most recently at SafetyKit, I was the sole marketer for a Series A AI company, working directly with co-founders and GTM leadership on everything from conference strategy and executive dinners to website development and sales collateral.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I built the marketing function at Mage, growing their Slack community to 7,500+ data professionals, managing agency partners, and coordinating product launches across engineering, product, and sales teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started my career as employee #2 at a luxury food startup, where I learned to build operational processes from nothing—handling product development, vendor relationships, and launch logistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of work, I've organized Toys for Tots SF for five years running, coordinating 300-500 attendees, volunteer teams, and venue logistics each December.
