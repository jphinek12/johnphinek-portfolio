          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I graduated from UCLA in 2020 and began my career at a luxury food startup
            as employee #2, handling product development and launch operations. I learned
            to establish processes with minimal resources and adapt quickly during growth phases.
          </p>
          <p>
            My marketing expertise developed at Mage, where I served as the first marketing
            lead (employee #6). I constructed the complete marketing infrastructure, emphasizing
            SEO, media partnerships, and community engagement with over 7,000 data professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Underline, I broadened my audience targeting across digital channels, events,
            and out-of-home advertising campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            Returning to Mage strategically, I directed full-funnel demand initiatives for
            Mage Pro, integrating product, lifecycle, and account-based marketing tactics
            across email, paid channels, and in-product messaging.
